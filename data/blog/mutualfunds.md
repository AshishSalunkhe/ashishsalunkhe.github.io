## So what is a Mutual Fund?

Mutual funds are collection of stocks or bonds that professional fund managers buy on your behalf. The quantity and distribution of stocks or bonds and decision about buying them is made entirely by fund manager.

The investment amount in any mutual fund is distributed in units. Investors buy these units instead of buying stocks direclty.

## How does a mutual fund work?

* The assets of the mutual fund are managed by the fund manager and they invested as adverties to initial investors.
* Fund manager will invest/buy shares depending on the type of fund.
 * Fund manager of an equity fund will buy shares of companies - called as equity.
 * Similarly, fund manager of a debt fund will invest in deposits of companies and/or government - called as debt.
* The performance of these investments affects the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund's assets.
* The unit size allocation is done based on the amount you invest and the NAV value on the date of investment.

## Expense Ratio

So every time when you try to invest in mutual funds, there are certain parameters that you take care of in order to put down the pros and cons of the fund. One such factor is expense ratio.
So what exactly is expense ratio?

A fund house has to cover its expenses - employee salaries, distributor commission, marketing costs and profit for fund house. This money is taken from the fund. This expense is charged in percentages of total assests - called as Expense Ratio.
This is usually in the range of 0.5% and 3%.

## Redeem / Withdrawal of Money from Fund

* When you want to withdraw money from the fund, you'll get the amount which is equal to the units sold multiplied by current net asset value (NAV).
* There's an exit load charged depending on the fund.
